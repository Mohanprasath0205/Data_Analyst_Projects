## Project Overview
As part of a virtual internship with Accenture through the Forage platform, I worked on a data analytics project focused on content performance analysis for a social media client, Social Buzz. The project aimed to uncover insights into user engagement and content categories to help Social Buzz optimize its content strategy.

## Project Objectives
1. Conduct data cleaning, modeling, and analysis to derive meaningful insights.
2. Identify the top-performing content categories based on user reactions.
3. Present insights effectively to the client through data visualizations.

## Project Approach
### 1. Understanding the Project Scope
- Reviewed client documentation and data models.
- Identified key questions, including: 
  - What datasets are required for analysis?
  - Which content categories perform best?
  - How do user reactions correlate with content types?
- Defined deliverables: clean dataset, insights, and a PowerPoint presentation.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Processed three main datasets:
  - **Reactions Table:** User reactions (reaction type, content ID, timestamp).
  - **Content Table:** Content metadata (content ID, category, type, URL).
  - **ReactionTypes Table:** Reaction sentiment and scoring.
- Key cleaning steps:
  - Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., URL, user ID).
  - Removed duplicate values (e.g., standardized category names).
  - Handled missing data by removing incomplete rows.

### 3. Data Modeling
- Merged datasets using **Excelâ€™s VLOOKUP function**.
- Established relationships between content categories and user reactions.
- Created a structured dataset for further analysis.

### 4. Data Analysis
- **Top 5 Performing Categories:** Used **SUMIF** to calculate total reaction scores and identified top categories.
- **Time-Based Analysis:** Extracted month from timestamps using **TEXT function** and counted post frequency using **COUNTIF**.
- **Unique Categories:** Identified 16 distinct content categories.

#### Key Findings:
- The **Animals** category had the highest user engagement.
- **November 2021** saw the highest number of content posts.

### 5. Presenting Insights to Clients
- Created a **PowerPoint presentation** to communicate findings.
- Presentation Structure:
  - **Project Recap:** Goals and objectives.
  - **Problem Statement:** How Social Buzz can optimize its content strategy.
  - **Top 5 Categories:** Bar chart visualization of high-performing categories.
  - **Data Analysis Process:** Overview of the approach taken.
  - **Key Insights:** Summary of findings.
  - **Visual Representations:** Bar and pie charts for better comprehension.
  - **Conclusion:** Summary of insights and actionable recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- **Excel:** Data cleaning, modeling, and analysis (VLOOKUP, SUMIF, COUNTIF functions).
- **PowerPoint:** Presentation of findings and visual storytelling.
- **Forage:** Virtual internship platform providing project framework and resources.

## Project Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience in data analytics and visualization.
- Developed strong skills in handling, cleaning, and structuring datasets.
- Improved ability to present analytical findings to business stakeholders.

## Conclusion
This virtual internship project enhanced my **data analytics, problem-solving, and communication skills** by working on a real-world business scenario. I learned the importance of **clear, data-driven storytelling** and **best practices in handling large datasets**. The project strengthened my technical abilities in **Excel-based data analysis** while also improving my capacity to present insights in a compelling and structured way.
