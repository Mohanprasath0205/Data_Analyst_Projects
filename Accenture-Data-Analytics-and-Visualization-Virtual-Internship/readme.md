## Project Overview
As part of a virtual internship with Accenture through the Forage platform, I worked on a data analytics project focused on content performance analysis for a social media client, Social Buzz. The project aimed to uncover insights into user engagement and content categories to help Social Buzz optimize its content strategy.

## Project Objectives
1. Conduct data cleaning, modeling, and analysis to derive meaningful insights.
2. Identify the top-performing content categories based on user reactions.
3. Present insights effectively to the client through data visualizations.

## Project Approach
### 1. Understanding the Project Scope
- Reviewed client documentation and data models.
- Identified key questions, including: 
  - What datasets are required for analysis?
  - Which content categories perform best?
  - How do user reactions correlate with content types?
- Defined deliverables: clean dataset, insights, and a PowerPoint presentation.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Processed three main datasets:
  - **Reactions Table:** User reactions (reaction type, content ID, timestamp).
  - **Content Table:** Content metadata (content ID, category, type, URL).
  - **ReactionTypes Table:** Reaction sentiment and scoring.
- Key cleaning steps:
  - Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., URL, user ID).
  - Removed duplicate values (e.g., standardized category names).
  - Handled missing data by removing incomplete rows.

### 3. Data Modeling
- Merged datasets using **Excelâ€™s VLOOKUP function**.
- Established relationships between content categories and user reactions.
- Created a structured dataset for further analysis.

### 4. Data Analysis
- **Top 5 Performing Categories:** Used **SUMIF** to calculate total reaction scores and identified top categories.
- **Time-Based Analysis:** Extracted month from timestamps using **TEXT function** and counted post frequency using **COUNTIF**.
- **Unique Categories:** Identified 16 distinct content categories.

#### Key Findings:
- The **Animals** category had the highest user engagement.
- **November 2021** saw the highest number of content posts.
