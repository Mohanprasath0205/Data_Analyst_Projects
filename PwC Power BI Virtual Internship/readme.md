## üîç Understanding the Business Need  
To build an effective dashboard, I first focused on **identifying the most critical KPIs** that would provide meaningful insights. The dataset contained various call center metrics, but I needed to determine which ones would be most useful for **measuring performance and improving customer service**.

---

## Key KPIs Selected for the Dashboard:

- ‚úÖ **Average Speed of Answer** ‚Äì Evaluating how quickly customers are assisted.  
- ‚úÖ **Agent Performance Quadrant** ‚Äì Comparing agent efficiency and identifying top performers.  

By focusing on these **core KPIs**, the dashboard provides managers with a **holistic view** of call center operations, helping them identify areas for improvement and optimize workforce allocation.
