## 🔍 Understanding the Business Need  
To build an effective dashboard, I first focused on **identifying the most critical KPIs** that would provide meaningful insights. The dataset contained various call center metrics, but I needed to determine which ones would be most useful for **measuring performance and improving customer service**.

---

## Key KPIs Selected for the Dashboard:  
- ✅ **Overall Customer Satisfaction** – Understanding customer sentiment.  
- ✅ **Calls Answered vs. Abandoned** – Measuring efficiency in handling customer calls.  
- ✅ **Call Volume by Time of Day** – Identifying peak hours for better staffing decisions.  
- ✅ **Average Speed of Answer** – Evaluating how quickly customers are assisted.  
- ✅ **Agent Performance Quadrant** – Comparing agent efficiency and identifying top performers.  

By focusing on these **core KPIs**, the dashboard provides managers with a **holistic view** of call center operations, helping them identify areas for improvement and optimize workforce allocation.
