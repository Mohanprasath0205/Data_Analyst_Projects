##  Project Overview  
This project involves developing an **interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard** using **Excel** to analyze accident data for **2021 and 2022**. The dashboard provides key insights into accident casualties, vehicle involvement, and accident trends, enabling data-driven decision-making.

##  Key Features & Insights  
-  **Total Casualties:** Displays the total number of casualties across both years.
-  **Casualty Percentage by Severity:** A visual breakdown of casualties categorized by accident severity.
-  **Vehicle Involvement:** Highlights the vehicle type with the highest casualties.
-  **Monthly Casualty Trends:** Compares casualties between the two years on a month-by-month basis.
-  **Casualties by Road Surface:** Analyzes casualty distribution across different road surfaces.
-  **Location & Time Analysis:** Examines accident trends based on **urban/rural** areas and **day vs. night** occurrences.

## 🛠️ Project Approach  
### 📂 1. Acquiring the Dataset
