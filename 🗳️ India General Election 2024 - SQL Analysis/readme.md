![-1x-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60fa75ac-ccf5-488c-be6c-142f81d1185a)


## 📌 Project Overview  
The **2024 Indian General Election** was one of the largest democratic events, with millions of voters across multiple states. This project aims to analyze the election results using **SQL** to gain insights into party performance, candidate success, and vote distributions.  

By structuring the election data into a **relational database schema**, this project enables efficient querying and analysis. The dataset consists of **five tables** capturing **constituency-wise, party-wise, and state-wise results**, which are processed and analyzed using SQL queries.

## 🎯 Problem Statement / Primary Goal  
### 🔥 Challenge  
Raw election data is often **scattered, unstructured, and difficult to analyze**. Various sources provide election results in **different formats** (state-wise, party-wise, constituency-wise), making it hard to compare performance effectively.  

### 💡 Primary Goal  
- Structure election data using **SQL tables**  
- Identify **party-wise and constituency-wise trends**  
- Analyze **vote margins, winning patterns, and close contests**  
- Provide insights using **aggregations and ranking functions**  

---

## 🛠 Solution Approach  
### **Step 1: Data Structuring**  
- Created **five relational tables** (`constituencywise_details`, `constituencywise_results`, `partywise_results`, `statewise_results`, and `states`)  
- Defined **primary and foreign keys** to establish relationships  
- Ensured **data normalization** for efficient queries  

### **Step 2: Data Analysis Using SQL**  
- Used **SQL joins** to combine constituency-wise and party-wise data  
- Applied **aggregation functions** (`SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`) to calculate total votes and margins  
- Implemented **window functions** (`RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`) to rank candidates based on votes  
- Used **subqueries and CTEs** to derive insights  

### **Step 3: Insights Extraction & Visualization**  
- Identified **top-winning parties** and their vote shares  
- Analyzed **constituencies with the closest vote margins**  
- Determined **state-wise leading and trailing candidates**  
- Created **Power BI visualizations** for better insights (if applicable)

## 📊 Business Insights  
This project helps answer key election-related questions:  
- 🏆 **Which party won the most seats across states?**  
- 📊 **What was the average margin of victory per constituency?**  
- 🏁 **Which states had the closest elections with tight margins?**  
- 🔥 **Which candidates received the highest number of votes?**  
- 🗳️ **How did each party perform in different states?**  

By structuring the data into an **SQL database**, stakeholders (media, researchers, policymakers) can efficiently analyze and interpret election trends.

## 🚀 Impact  
✅ **Faster Data Analysis** – SQL queries allow for quick insights into election trends  
✅ **Accurate Trend Identification** – Helps in understanding voting patterns at different levels  
✅ **Decision-Making Support** – Useful for political analysts and researchers  
✅ **Scalability** – The structured approach allows future election datasets to be easily integrated

## 📈 Results  
- 🏛️ **Successfully structured** large-scale election data into a **normalized SQL database**  
- 🔍 **Extracted key insights** like **party dominance, close contests, and state-wise performance**  
- 📊 **Generated SQL-based reports** summarizing election trends  
- 🎯 **Created ERD/schema for better data visualization and understanding**
